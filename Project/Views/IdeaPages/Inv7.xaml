In Indian most of the population is dependent on crops. However, there is also needed to review and revitalize the mechanism for updating the technology. In the upcoming years agriculture will see major changes. The main purpose for such project is to develop a mobile phone-based solution that helps in crop management, leads to agricultural yield improvement, and helps in care/maintenance of the crops. The large amount of crop is getting damage in the field due to the bacterial attacks and lack of information resources. Annually, such loss exceeds 40% in total. So, the paper presented here suggest various ways in which a farmer can utilize on their handsets using application called crop management system, to assist them for relatively better cultivation and merchandise. Our proposed crop management system application will provide the details about customer and farmer and also it avoids the third-party buyer problem which cause problem for farmers. This project used to search for fertilizer and cultivate crop. This helps to update the fertilizer and crop and cultivate. And shows the result of the crop cultivated ."
