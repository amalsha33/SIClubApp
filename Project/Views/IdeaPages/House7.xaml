That simple switch -in a recipe perfected over 10 months of trial and error- has yielded a healthy twist on the al dente dinner.
 Banza, shorthand for garbanzo pasta, has double the protein and four times the fiber of traditional pasta, and far fewer carbs; it's also gluten-free. 
And to those who may question how good it tastes, consider the sales. 
Banza launched in two U.S. stores last year; now it's in 1,700, including Fairway markets, where it was recently the top-¬selling pasta of any kind (including wheat). 
Now Rudolph and his brother Scott plan to reinvent products like pizza and cereal.
People want to eat better, he says. We see Banza as a true replacement, a more filling version of the food people love."
