The possibility of illegal access of private data is also increased.
The aim of this project is to filter the network
activities and to decide which are illegal of them.
The process is like spam filtering from emails.
Tool : This project is based on Machine learning algorithms
where we will make a classifier which will take some
test network inputs and learn from them, the learning procedure will
extract the features of specific inputs and stores them for detection
of upcoming Inputs. We can use Matlab or Octave tool
for this project because the algorithms used are difficult to implement
in languages like c++ or Java, but we can use R language for some modules.
Implementation: We can use perceptron algorithms for making the classifier.
They come under the category of supervised learning.
 For implementing the detector we will feed all
types of malicious activities to the classifier
one by one then all those characteristics which signifies
the illegal activity will be stored in our classifier 
then this detail can be compared with the neutral activities
for differentiation between general and malicious access.
