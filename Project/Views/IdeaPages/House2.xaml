There is also a large touch screen on one of its doors, and it includes an intelligent voice assistant that responds to commands, such as playing classical music, and more. It also contains a camera that takes pictures of its contents and sends them to users' phones.
A set of applications can be downloaded into the design of the refrigerator, allowing the use of the calendar and television through it, as well as the music player. A series of cameras and apps work together to provide home-related information."
