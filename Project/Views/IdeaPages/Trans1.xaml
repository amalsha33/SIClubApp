Every year, thousands of people get hurt or die in traffic accidents, in part because their visibility gets blocked by a lumbering vehicle. 
This is especially true in Argentina, known for its winding, narrow roads.
 There, however, Samsung and ad agency Leo Burnett have partnered on a creative solution: a system that relays video footage from the front of a truck to four screens on its back, giving drivers a clear view of what's ahead. During its initial test, the Safety Truck covered some 620 miles (1,000 km) over three days without incident. 
Now Samsung is refining the technology and working with Argentine officials to roll it out more broadly. 
We believe this will change the history of road safety, says Sang Jik Lee, president of Samsung Electronics Argentina.
