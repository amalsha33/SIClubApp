It can be installed on the walls of homes, companies and all other interior places, just like wallpaper, and it does not require wires or electrical current of any kind, but rather relies on hundreds of sensors that cover the square pieces of that surface, which can capture and reflect the traveling waves in the place. With the increase in the concentration of those waves inside the place lined with that smart surface very greatly, which leads to an increase in the speed of the wireless Internet to about ten times the official speed.
